With 3 meters high and 28 square meters, it accommodates 4 people. Located on a 1.2 hectare property by the river Austreberthe, our rustic treehouse shares the space with our garden rabbits and dumplings, as well as wild dumplings and our beloved khenty mare, who loves apples and carrots. A tranquil retreat, with efficient thermal insulation and heaters for the colder days.

Other things to note\\n*When it's windy, the cabin squeaks, but there's nothing to worry about.\\n\\n*Do not use candles or objects containing a fire inside and outside the cabin as the polyester is flammable.\\n\\n*Smoking outside only please.\\n\\n*Our dear pets are allowed but with the commitment of their guardian not to leave them on the bed and furnishing fabrics, as well as being responsible for their waste.\\n\\n*Pine needles often fall on the balcony, which doesn't mean the space hasn't been cleaned.\\n\\n*As this is literally a house between the trees, it is common that there are insects and cobwebs outside but with the door closed it will prevent them from entering the cabin.\\n\\n*With the arrival of the cold season, we see that the internal temperature is between 15 and 18 degrees.\\n\\n*Check-out time must be respected so as not to change the arrival time of the next guest.\n",
